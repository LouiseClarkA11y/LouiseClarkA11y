# Hi, I'm Louise. 👋

## About Me
I am ex-US Digital Service accessibility lead (2022-2025), and an IAAP Certified Professional in Web Accessibility (CPWA). 

♿ I believe great accessibility programs depend on strong relationships and real collaboration to co-design processes and solutions.

🔥 What fires me up is helping teams discover they already have the power to make things better.

🚫 I don't believe in quick fixes, fast follows, or superhero consultants who swoop in with all the answers and loads of judgement. 

😄 I work to honor multiple ways of knowing by building processes that share power with communities, amplifying their wisdom, expertise, and lived experience.

## How I Work
I listen first. Really listen to understand what's actually going on before suggesting fixes. Technology is the easy part. The hard part is understanding how people, organizations, and environments connect across silos. 

I ask uncomfortable questions: Who gets left out? Who decides what "good" looks like? What are the unintended consequences? These power dynamics shape everything. 

I measure what matters to actual people: Can you complete the task? Does it feel good to use? Do you feel welcome here? 

I believe in slowing down to speed up. When we rush digital transformation, we create barriers that hurt real people. Taking time upfront saves everyone pain later.
